We hope that the solutions that emerge from here on will protect the poor from this cost," Baswal said.  About 3% of Indian women have had hysterectomies, according to a government survey in 2018, which showed that half of the women had never gone to school and two-thirds of surgeries were performed in private hospitals.  Hysterectomies are never the solution to most of the health problems Indian women present to doctors, such as irregular periods, white discharge or pelvic pain, medical experts say.

But the high cost of hysterectomies driving families into slavery had largely gone unnoticed, human rights activists said.  India is home to an estimated 8 million modern-day slaves, working at farms, factories and fisheries, trapped in the sex trade or forced into marriages, according to the Global Slavery Index by the Australia-based charity Walk Free Foundation.  Human rights campaigners quoted in the Thomson Reuters Foundation investigation were invited to the government-backed consultation this week to share their data on women who had undergone the surgery in their respective regions.  "This (the consultation) is a beginning," said Bharath Bhushan, founder of Centre for Action Research and People's Development (CARPED) - one of the first organisations to study the medical malpractice in 2005.  "The government is acting now but hysterectomies cannot be viewed simply as a medical problem," Bhushan said. "This is the outcome of years of medical malpractice that has forced many into bondage."
