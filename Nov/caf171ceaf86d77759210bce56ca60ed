How's your PR politics coming along? Could you kindly explain to Nairobi residents your interest on this matter?

November 6, 2019   Senator @SakajaJohnson has no spine to go against the grain. He is a modern day version of Kalonzo Musyoka, a cowardly, fence sitter. Sakaja is President Uhuru’s rubber stamp! He is even afraid of holding Gov. @MikeSonko accountable. Sakaja is playing survival politics. Shame. https://t.co/ikzo4mQlnj
