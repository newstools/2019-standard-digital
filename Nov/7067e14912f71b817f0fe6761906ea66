We don't have any issues. We have had a good campaign. I said this should be about a contest of ideas, not personalities. I am satisfied with the progress so far. We had issues with the voter register. The roll that was issued did not have the ID numbers. We wanted to compare the register with the 2017 roll.  There are claims of massive voter bribery. We have taken note over that and we will gather more evidence. We have also asked IEBC to redeem its dented image. We want a free and fair process. We will accept the outcome so long it would be credible and fair.  Mudavadi: This is a very important day for the people of Kibra and we want IEBC to ensure a free and fair election. There were incidents of intimidation at Shimoni. We want to ask the police, IEBC to work hand in hand with the agents of the candidates. I want to ask employers to allow the locals to go and cast their votes as the outcome will have a great impact on their lives.  11:05   Imran Okoth casts his vote.
