Shalom Hospital, Machakos Branch, has myriad process failures,  2. The hospital lacks proper procedures and staffing,  3. The death of the infant who passed away could have been prevented,  4. A clinical officer and pharmacist gave the wrong dosage of a drug to be administered - 20 times more that expected.  5. The person who administered the injection was NOT a trained health worker but a hospital attendant with no medical training at all,  6. The drug (morphine) is a narcotic and should not have been the first dose of prescription.  7.  The hospitals’s infrastructure and general condition is wanting.  In lieu of this and many other factors, the following decision has been arrived at:  A. The following employees of the hospital to be arrested and charged at once with various crimes that may include manslaughter:  1.  The Proprietors/Directors of the hospital  2. Hospital administrator  3. Doctor in charge  4. Pharmacist in charge  5. Clinical officer concerned  6. Patient attendant who administered the drug  B. My Government has revoked the operating license of the hospital until further notice.  C. The Medical Board has suspended the hospital’s operating license until further notice  D. CLOSURE OF SHALOM HOSPITAL, MACHAKOS BRANCH UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.  E. No new in patients to be seen and those undergoing treatment to be treated until 6 pm today.  F. In-patient patients in wards to be moved to other hospitals including Machakos County hospitals, within 48 hours.  G. Investigations that were started in the Athi River Branch of Shalom hospital to continue with results to be given on Friday of this week.  I urge members of the public to first visit the free Machakos county hospitals that have been revamped and working very well before heading to private hospitals.  My sincere condolences to the family of the child - Jonathan Musau and his wife and their family for this loss. It is very very sad and breaks my heart. God give you strength at this difficult time.
