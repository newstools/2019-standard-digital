King Kaka painted Waiguru in his sensational song “Wajinga Nyinyi” (you are fools) as among the corrupt leaders in the country referring to the National Youth Scandal scandal when she was adversely mentioned.   The award-winning Kenyan rapper kicked up a storm with his song accusing politicians and Kenyans of being co-authors of the country’s misfortunes.  In response to the song, Waiguru slapped King Kaka with a list of demands including issuing an apology and pulling down the video on all his social media platforms  Failure to which, she would file a defamation suit against the “Wajinga Nyinyi” hitmaker.  Lawyer Ahmednasir, however, opines that King Kaka did not defame any politicians in his song because the song was highlighting the truth on Kenya’s tattered social fabric.
