But the UNHCR said the outbreak was not linked to conditions at the shelter.  "Samples were analysed for bacterial infection, including cholera, and were found to be negative," Yvonne Ndege, UNHCR Kenya's spokeswoman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  "Samples have been sent for further analysis to the national government laboratory. The assessment team did not establish any connection between the conditions at facility and the diarrhea."

U.N. officials say this is for their own security.  The UNHCR said the shelter was an emergency measure and they were in the process of finding more suitable accommodation - but did not give a time frame on when it would happen.  African countries have some of the most prohibitive laws against homosexuality in the world. Gay sex is punishable with up to 14 years in jail in Kenya. The law is rarely enforced but discrimination is widespread.  Kenya's LGBT+ refugees need speedy resettlement in another country where they can be free and safe, say rights groups, but this can take years as most Western nations do not prioritise sexual minorities when considering asylum requests.
