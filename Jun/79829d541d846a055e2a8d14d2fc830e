Mum dies after mistaking symptoms of deadly disease for start of menopause             Daily Mirror  15th Jun 2019 12:36:00 GMT +0300 Daily Mirror  15th Jun 2019 12:36:00 GMT +0300 Daily Mirror     A mum died from a brain tumour after thinking warning signs were the start of the menopause. Former nurse, Lucy Farnsworth, 52, went to see her doctor as she had started to forget things and initially put it down to the menopause. But when her GP saw she was unable to read the clock face on the wall or recall her address when asked, the mum-of-two was sent immediately to hospital. After undergoing scans and tests, she was given the devastating news she had a brain tumour and within a week was told she was terminally ill. Despite an operation to remove the tumour and chemotherapy, Lucy was then diagnosed with breast cancer and her body was unable to fight back. Lucy Farnsworth, of Driffield, East Yorkshire, passed away in May 2018, only 14 months after being diagnosed. Close friend, Sami Dee, said: “There were no real signs for Lucy of being ill, other than her becoming forgetful, and that's why she decided to book a doctor's appointment. “She was sent straight to Hull Royal at the doctors as she couldn't read a clock face to tell the time or remember what her address was. "All the staff at the hospital were great with her and really looked after her, but she was diagnosed the same day with a brain tumour after tests and became terminally ill within a week. "She had an operation to try and remove the tumour and chemo. “She seemed to be getting better and was amazing at coping with it all - she was even training on a cross trainer to keep fit. "But then she was diagnosed with breast cancer and that made her really ill - she was so tough throughout her treatment and operation but sadly passed away on May 30 last year." Farnsworth, who is survived by her husband James and two children Emma, 18 and Edward, 19. Her family and friends are now trying to raise money for the Brain Tumour Research charity. "We were all devastated to lose our dear friend Lucy," said Sami. "We’d been friends for 36 years and she was part of the patchwork quilt of our family. We miss her every single day. "Lucy was kind, cheeky and a little bit naughty. She lit up the room and was just everybody's friend and such a nice person...I don't think we will ever get over losing her.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1498022554617-0'); }); Register to advertise your products & services on our classifieds website Digger.co.ke and enjoy one month subscription free of charge and 3 free ads on the Standard newspaper.
