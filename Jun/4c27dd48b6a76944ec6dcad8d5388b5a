Reconstructive surgery involves breaking open the scar formed by FGM, and pulling the clitoris, the majority of which lies beneath the surface, back to the surface, relieving the pain associated with FGM and restoring sensitivity.  The technique was developed in 2004 by French urologist Pierre Foldes, who has trained hundreds of doctors in the practice.  Doctors from Clitoraid, a U.S.-based non-profit, have performed 500 such surgeries since 2009 and have a two-year waiting list.

Magoko meets women in Kenya and across Europe who have undergone FGM, some who have had reconstructive surgery and others who have never heard of it, including her mother.  One woman in the film told her reconstruction was the best decision she ever made. Another said she would not do it because it was "impossible to imagine someone touching me there".  All speak of the emotional trauma and physical pain from the resulting scar tissue that can make childbirth, sex and periods excruciating.  While FGM is outlawed in 22 countries, according to the campaign group 28 Too Many, the news about reconstructive surgery has not reached many villages, Magoko said.

Magoko's goal is to screen "In Search..." where FGM is practised, including her home country Kenya.  Six African countries - Chad, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan - do not criminalise FGM, which world leaders pledged to end under global development goals in 2015.  Magoko said she wants to share the stories of FGM survivors and shatter the stigma, but she needed to help herself before she could help others.  "There's no way I could help other women if my story or my history is still present and it's haunting me," she said.  "I felt like young Beryl got justice."
