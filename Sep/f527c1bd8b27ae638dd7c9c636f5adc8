London Distillers Kenya (LDK) Company has written to the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) saying that their effluent is molasses and not toxic.   LDK has requested EPZA to grant them 30 days to repair their blocked manholes, the vandalised pipes and start the factory operations.  “We will invite your technical team to come over and grant us more advice as they collect samples for further analysis,” added PS Mann, General Manager Administration.  EPZA in response to LDK’s letter has said that the company’s licence to discharge any effluent to their sewer line shall remain suspended until it will be confirmed that the effluent emitted from their factory meets the required international standards.
