[Standard]  Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot, who is spearheading the Punguza Mizigo initiative. [Standard] Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot has accused the state of bribing Members of the Murang’a County Assembly after the second rejection of his Punguza Mizigo Bill in central Kenya.   Some of the Murang’a MCAs were not convinced that the bill was a deal for the common Mwanachi citing underrepresentation as the major demerit of Punguza Mizigo.  Some termed the bill as a depreciative of devolution.  “Before the deadline of October 22, the state and powers that be would have spent KES 250 million of your taxes attempting or actually bribing (as it happened in Murang'a today) the 2500 MCAs to reject Punguza Mizigo Bill. I wonder why?” posted Aukot on Twitter.
